        Where it is possible to provide pre-defined choices, the user can select from a list of valid input values.
        Where users must manually enter numerical inputs, alternative separator characters are accepted.</p>

    Exceptions:
<ul>
    <li>    Where pre-defined choices for a piece of data have more than thirty-one valid values, it is not necessary to provide pre-defined choices. For example, a piece of data with more then 31 choices could be a year in a date field.
  </li><li>    Where pre-defined choices interfere with the main purpose of the content.
    </li><li>     Where alternative separator characters could alter the numeric value, such as substituting commas with periods.
</li></ul>
