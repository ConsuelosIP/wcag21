  <p>Where users are required to submit information, all of the following are true:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Where all possible inputs come from a discrete set of data values, a user can select from a choice of valid input values without manually entering the value.</li>
      <li>Where numerical data needs to be manually entered, a user can leave out separator characters or use alternative separator characters.</li>
    </ol>

 <p>Exceptions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Where the set of discrete data values is larger than thirty-one valid values.</li>
      <li>Where providing a list of valid input values interferes with the main purpose of the content.</li>
      <li>Where leaving out or substituting separator characters could alter the numeric value, such as substituting commas with periods.</li>
    </ul> 
  <h3>Definitions</h3>
  <p><strong>Separator characters</strong></p>
  <p>Delineators between sequences of numbers, which are used to separate a long numeric string into culturally 
    or visually accepted groupings. Separators are common in dates, phone numbers and identify numbers. 
    Common separators include forward slashes (/), colons (:), dashes (-), commas (,) and spaces. 
    In a numeric string, an alternative separator key could be any alpha or punctuation key which does not 
    affect the value of the numeric string.</p>
  <p><strong>Discrete data</strong></p>  
  <p>Data that can only take certain values. Discrete data is based on counts. Only a finite number of values is possible, 
    and the values cannot be subdivided meaningfully.</p>
