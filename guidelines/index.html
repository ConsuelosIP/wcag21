    <p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these. These guidelines address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. Following these guidelines will also often make your Web content more usable to users in general.</p>
    <p>WCAG 2.1 success criteria are written as testable statements that are not technology-specific. Guidance about satisfying the success criteria in specific technologies, as well as general information about interpreting the success criteria, is provided in separate documents. See <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview</a> for an introduction and links to WCAG technical and educational material.</p>
    <p>WCAG 2.1 extends <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0</a> [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-WCAG20">WCAG20</a></cite>], which was published as a <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Recommendation December 2008. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.1 also conforms to WCAG 2.0, and therefore to policies that reference WCAG 2.0.
      <!--The W3C recommends that new and updated content use WCAG 2.1 to maximize future applicability of accessibility efforts. The W3C also recommends that new or updated Web accessibility policies reference WCAG 2.1.-->

      <p>This is a draft of the guidelines, published to allow initial review of the structure, approach, and types of new success criteria. It does not yet include all the Success Criteria that have been proposed for WCAG 2.1, nor are the ones present necessarily in their final form.</p>
      <p>Because WCAG 2.1 extends WCAG 2.0, all the Success Criteria from WCAG 2.0 are included. To differentiate new Success Criteria, they are labeled as "[New]" and displayed in a <span class="new">green box</span>. In this draft the WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria remain unchanged. This does create some redundancy but the Working Group seeks review of the new Success Criteria at this time and will evaluate where to modify existing WCAG 2.0 Success Criteria later in the process. </p>
      <p>Not all Success Criteria proposals are included in the above list. The Working Group maintains a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/wcag21/issues/">full set of current Success Criterion proposals</a> which is also available for review and consideration for inclusion in future drafts.</p>

      <p>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 defines how to make Web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. Although these guidelines cover a wide range of issues, they are not able to address the needs of people with all types, degrees, and combinations of disability. These guidelines also make Web content more usable by older individuals with changing abilities due to aging and often improve usability for users in general.</p>
      <p>WCAG 2.1 is developed through the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/w3c-process.php"><abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> process</a> in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world, with a goal of providing a shared standard for Web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally. WCAG 2.1 builds on WCAG 2.0 [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-WCAG20">WCAG20</a></cite>], which in turn built on WCAG 1.0 [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-WAI-WEBCONTENT">WAI-WEBCONTENT</a></cite>] and is designed to apply broadly to different Web technologies now and in the future, and to be testable with a combination of automated testing and human evaluation. For an introduction to WCAG, see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview</a>.</p>
      <p>Web accessibility depends not only on accessible content but also on accessible Web browsers and other user agents. Authoring tools also have an important role in Web accessibility. For an overview of how these components of Web development and interaction work together, see:</p>

      <p>WCAG 2.1 uses the same conformance model as WCAG 2.0, which is described in the <a href="#conformance">Conformance</a> section. The conformance section has not been updated in this Working Draft to describe how WCAG 2.1 conformance builds upon WCAG 2.0 conformance. In particular, it is intended that sites that conform to WCAG 2.1 also conform to WCAG 2.0, which means they meet the requirements of any policies that reference WCAG 2.0, while also better meeting the needs of users on the current Web. Conformance wording for this will be provided in a future Working Draft.</p>

      <p>The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group plans to continue developing WCAG 2.1 over the course of 2017. This work will primarily involve review and processing of the Success Criteria proposals, response to public feedback on this and later Working Drafts, and preparation of support materials similar to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/">Understanding WCAG 2.0</a> [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20">UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20</a></cite>] and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/">Techniques for WCAG 2.0</a> [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-WCAG20-TECHS">WCAG20-TECHS</a></cite>]. Early feedback on this work as soon as it is available is important, because the Working Group intends to begin finalization stages towards the end of the year.</p>
      <p>Once the set of Success Criteria has been decided for WCAG 2.1, the Working Group will review the structure of the document. One goal will be to achieve the most clear backwards compatibility possible with WCAG 2.0; another will be to optimize the new Success Criteria to reduce duplication and increase clarity. The Working Group will also make final decisions about characteristics of the specification such as numbering and position of added Success Criteria. In preparation for the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#candidate-rec">Candidate Recommendation</a>, the Working Group will also re-evaluate testability and implementability of the Success Criteria given the technologies available at that time.</p>

      </h3>
      <p>In parallel with WCAG 2.1, the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is working on requirements for a 3.0 version of accessibility guidelines, developed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/task-forces/silver/">Silver Task Force</a>. The result of this work is expected to be a more substantial restructuring of web accessibility guidance than would be realistic for dot-releases of WCAG 2. The task force follows a research-focused, user-centered design methodology to produce the most effective and flexible outcome, including the roles of content authoring, user agent support, and authoring tool support. This is a multi-year effort, so WCAG 2.1 is needed as an interim measure to provide updated web accessibility guidance to reflect changes on the web since the publication of WCAG 2.0.</p>
      <p>In order for WCAG 2.1 to achieve its goal to update web accessibility guidance in a time frame that is meaningful before the 3.0 project delivers results, WCAG 2.1 must be completed quickly. This inherently means that some proposed Success Criteria may prove too complex to include in WCAG 2.1, but nonetheless will be viewed as important accessibility guidance for current web content. The larger 3.0 project is expected to incorporate such guidance, but the Working Group could also decide that another set of guidelines between WCAG 2.1 and 3.0 is needed. In that case, a new version, WCAG 2.2, could be proposed. A decision to develop WCAG 2.2 will need to balance the benefits of providing additional accessibility guidance earlier, versus the opportunity cost the work could have on the more substantially restructured and comprehensive 3.0 project. The current <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/01/ag-charter">Accessibility Guidelines Working Group charter</a> states "The Working Group intends to produce updated guidance for accessibility on a regular interval, starting with WCAG 2.1. Depending on the outcome of the requirements development for the next major update to WCAG, it may be necessary to pursue further dot-releases of WCAG until a major release is ready to be completed in time for a scheduled release date."</p>

      <p>In order for a Web page to conform to WCAG 2.1, all of the following conformance requirements must be satisfied:</p>

            <a class="respec-offending-element" title="Linking error: not matching <dfn>">satisfies</a> all the Level A Success Criteria, or a <a class="respec-offending-element" title="Linking error: not matching <dfn>">conforming alternate version</a> is provided.</li>
          <li>For Level AA conformance, the Web page satisfies all the Level A and Level AA Success Criteria, or a Level AA conforming alternate version is provided.</li>
          <li>For Level AAA conformance, the Web page satisfies all the Level A, Level AA and Level AAA Success Criteria, or a Level AAA conforming alternate version is provided.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Although conformance can only be achieved at the stated levels, authors are encouraged to report (in their claim) any progress toward meeting success criteria from all levels beyond the achieved level of conformance.</p>
        <p>It is not recommended that Level AAA conformance be required as a general policy for entire sites because it is not possible to satisfy all Level AAA Success Criteria for some content.</p>

      <p>Sometimes, Web pages are created that will later have additional content added to them. For example, an email program, a blog, an article that allows users to add comments, or applications supporting user-contributed content. Another example would be a page, such as a portal or news site, composed of content aggregated from multiple contributors, or sites that automatically insert content from other sources over time, such as when advertisements are inserted dynamically.</p>
      <p>In these cases, it is not possible to know at the time of original posting what the uncontrolled content of the pages will be. It is important to note that the uncontrolled content can affect the accessibility of the controlled content as well. Two options are available:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>A determination of conformance can be made based on best knowledge. If a page of this type is monitored and repaired (non-conforming content is removed or brought into conformance) within two business days, then a determination or claim of conformance can be made since, except for errors in externally contributed content which are corrected or removed when encountered, the page conforms. No conformance claim can be made if it is not possible to monitor or correct non-conforming content;</p>
          <p><strong>OR</strong></p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>A "statement of partial conformance" may be made that the page does not conform, but could conform if certain parts were removed. The form of that statement would be, "This page does not conform, but would conform to WCAG 2.1 at level X if the following parts from uncontrolled sources were removed." In addition, the following would also be true of uncontrolled content that is described in the statement of partial conformance:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>It is not content that is under the author's control.</li>
            <li>It is described in a way that users can identify (e.g., they cannot be described as "all parts that we do not control" unless they are clearly marked as such.)</li>

   <p>The WCAG Working group and the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> do not specify which or how much support by assistive
      technologies there must be for a particular use of a Web technology in order for it
      to be classified as accessibility supported. (See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance">Level of Assistive Technology Support Needed for "Accessibility Support"</a>.)
   </p>
   
   <p>Web technologies can be used in ways that are not accessibility supported as long
      as they are not <a class="respec-offending-element" title="Linking error: not matching <dfn>">relied upon</a> and the page as a whole meets the conformance requirements, including <a href="#cc4">Conformance Criterion 4</a> and <a href="#cc5">Conformance Criterion 5</a>, are met.
   </p>
   
   <p>When a <a class="respec-offending-element" title="Linking error: not matching <dfn>">Web Technology</a> is used in a way that is "accessibility supported," it does not imply that the entire
      technology or all uses of the technology are supported. Most technologies, including
      HTML, lack support for at least one feature or use. Pages conform to WCAG only if
      the uses of the technology that are accessibility supported can be relied upon to
      meet WCAG requirements.
   </p>
   
   <p>When citing Web content technologies that have multiple versions, the version(s) supported
      should be specified.
   </p>
   
   <p>One way for authors to locate uses of a technology that are accessibility supported
      would be to consult compilations of uses that are documented to be accessibility supported.
      (See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance">Understanding Accessibility-Supported Web Technology Uses</a>.) Authors, companies, technology vendors, or others may document accessibility-supported
      ways of using Web content technologies. However, all ways of using technologies in
      the documentation would need to meet the definition of accessibility-supported Web
      content technologies above.

   <p>hardware and/or software that acts as a <a class="respec-offending-element" title="Linking error: not matching <dfn>">user agent</a>, or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements
      of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agents
   </p>
   
   <p>functionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations
      (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g.,
      voice), additional navigation or orientation mechanisms, and content transformations
      (e.g., to make tables more accessible).
   </p>
   
   <p>Assistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream user agents
      by using and monitoring APIs.
   </p>
   
   <p>The distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute.
      Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities.
      The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences
      that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies
      target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance
      provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs
      of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality
      to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing
      markup into identifiable bundles.
   </p>
   
   <p>Assistive technologies that are important in the context of this document include
      the following:
   </p>
   
   <ul>
      
      <li>screen magnifiers, and other visual reading assistants, which are used by people with
         visual, perceptual and physical print disabilities to change text font, size, spacing,
         color, synchronization with speech, etc. in order to improve the visual readability
         of rendered text and images;
      </li>
      
      <li>screen readers, which are used by people who are blind to read textual information
         through synthesized speech or braille;
      </li>
      
      <li>text-to-speech software, which is used by some people with cognitive, language, and
         learning disabilities to convert text into synthetic speech;
      </li>
      
      <li>speech recognition software, which may be used by people who have some physical disabilities;</li>
      
      <li>alternative keyboards, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities
         to simulate the keyboard (including alternate keyboards that use head pointers, single
         switches, sip/puff and other special input devices.);
      </li>
      
      <li>alternative pointing devices, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities

   </ul>
   
   <p>Contrast ratios can range from 1 to 21 (commonly written 1:1 to 21:1).</p>
   
   <p>Because authors do not have control over user settings as to how text is rendered
      (for example font smoothing or anti-aliasing), the contrast ratio for text can be
      evaluated with anti-aliasing turned off.
   </p>
   
   <p>For the purpose of Success Criteria 1.4.3 and 1.4.6, contrast is measured with respect
      to the specified background over which the text is rendered in normal usage. If no
      background color is specified, then white is assumed.
   </p>
   
   <p>Background color is the specified color of content over which the text is to be rendered
      in normal usage. It is a failure if no background color is specified when the text
      color is specified, because the user's default background color is unknown and cannot
      be evaluated for sufficient contrast. For the same reason, it is a failure if no text
      color is specified when a background color is specified.
   </p>
   
   <p>When there is a border around the letter, the border can add contrast and would be
      used in calculating the contrast between the letter and its background. A narrow border
      around the letter would be used as the letter. A wide border around the letter that
      fills in the inner details of the letters acts as a halo and would be considered background.
   </p>
   
   <p>WCAG conformance should be evaluated for color pairs specified in the content that
      an author would expect to appear adjacent in typical presentation. Authors need not
      consider unusual presentations, such as color changes made by the user agent, except
      where caused by authors' code.

      <li>A <strong>general flash</strong> is defined as a pair of opposing changes in <a class="respec-offending-element" title="Linking error: not matching <dfn>">relative luminance</a> of 10% or more of the maximum relative luminance where the relative luminance of
         the darker image is below 0.80; and where "a pair of opposing changes" is an increase
         followed by a decrease, or a decrease followed by an increase, and
      </li>
      
      <li>A <strong>red flash</strong> is defined as any pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red.
      </li>
      
   </ul>
   
   <p><em>Exception:</em> Flashing that is a fine, balanced, pattern such as white noise or an alternating
      checkerboard pattern with "squares" smaller than 0.1 degree (of visual field at typical
      viewing distance) on a side does not violate the thresholds.
   </p>
   
   <p>For general software or Web content, using a 341 x 256 pixel rectangle anywhere on
      the displayed screen area when the content is viewed at 1024 x 768 pixels will provide
      a good estimate of a 10 degree visual field for standard screen sizes and viewing
      distances (e.g., 15-17 inch screen at 22-26 inches). (Higher resolutions displays
      showing the same rendering of the content yield smaller and safer images so it is
      lower resolutions that are used to define the thresholds.)
   </p>
   
   <p>A transition is the change in relative luminance (or relative luminance/color for
      red flashing) between adjacent peaks and valleys in&nbsp;a plot of relative luminance (or
      relative luminance/color for red flashing) measurement against time. A flash consists
      of two opposing transitions.
   </p>
   
   <p>The current working definition in the field for <strong>"pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red"</strong> is where, for either or both states involved in each transition, R/(R+ G + B) &gt;=
      0.8, and the change in the value of (R-G-B)x320 is &gt; 20 (negative values of (R-G-B)x320
      are set to zero) for both transitions. R, G, B values range from 0-1 as specified
      in “relative luminance” definition. [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-HARDING-BINNIE">HARDING-BINNIE</a></cite>]
   </p>
   
   <p>Tools are available that will carry out analysis from video screen capture. However,
      no tool is necessary to evaluate for this condition if flashing is less than or equal
      to 3 flashes in any one second. Content automatically passes (see #1 and #2 above).

   <p>with at least 18 point or 14 point bold or font size that would yield equivalent size
      for Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) fonts
   </p>
   
   <p>Fonts with extraordinarily thin strokes or unusual features and characteristics that
      reduce the familiarity of their letter forms are harder to read, especially at lower
      contrast levels.
   </p>
   
   <p>Font size is the size when the content is delivered. It does not include resizing
      that may be done by a user.
   </p>
   
   <p>The actual size of the character that a user sees is dependent both on the author-defined
      size and the user's display or user-agent settings. For many mainstream body text
      fonts, 14 and 18 point is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150%
      of the default size for body text (assuming that the body font is 100%), but authors
      would need to check this for the particular fonts in use. When fonts are defined in
      relative units, the actual point size is calculated by the user agent for display.
      The point size should be obtained from the user agent, or calculated based on font
      metrics as the user agent does, when evaluating this success criterion. Users who
      have low vision would be responsible for choosing appropriate settings.
   </p>
   
   <p>When using text without specifying the font size, the smallest font size used on major
      browsers for unspecified text would be a reasonable size to assume for the font. If
      a level 1 heading is rendered in 14pt bold or higher on major browsers, then it would
      be reasonable to assume it is large text. Relative scaling can be calculated from
      the default sizes in a similar fashion.
   </p>
   
   <p>The 18 and 14 point sizes for roman texts are taken from the minimum size for large
      print (14pt) and the larger standard font size (18pt). For other fonts such as CJK
      languages, the "equivalent" sizes would be the minimum large print size used for those
      languages and the next larger standard large print size.

   <p>the relative brightness of any point in a colorspace, normalized to 0 for darkest
      black and 1 for lightest white

   <p>The "^" character is the exponentiation operator. (Formula taken from [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-sRGB">sRGB</a></cite>] and
      [<cite><a class="bibref" href="#bib-IEC-4WD">IEC-4WD</a></cite>]).
   </p>
   
   <p>Almost all systems used today to view Web content assume sRGB encoding. Unless it
      is known that another color space will be used to process and display the content,
      authors should evaluate using sRGB colorspace. If using other color spaces, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast-contrast">Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.3</a>.
   </p>
   
   <p>If dithering occurs after delivery, then the source color value is used. For colors
      that are dithered at the source, the average values of the colors that are dithered
      should be used (average R, average G, and average B).
   </p>
   
   <p>Tools are available that automatically do the calculations when testing contrast and
      flash.
