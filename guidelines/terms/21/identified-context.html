   <p>Word lists by frequency are lists of a language's words grouped by frequency of occurrence within some given text corpus from the same context. Examples of a context include a dialect, subject matter or profession.  A word frequency list has to be generated from at least 1000 sources from the same context although 50,000 sources  is recommended . the word frequency list and he context should be identified in the sites meta data, or in an accessibility statement or by some other known technique.
