                    <p>If <a> technologies </a> are used in a way that is not <a>accessibility supported</a>, or if they are used in a non-conforming way, then they do not block the ability of users to access the rest of the page. In addition, the <a>Web page</a> as a whole continues to meet the conformance requirements under each of the following conditions:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>when any technology that is not <a>relied upon</a> is turned on in a user agent,</li>
                        <li>when any technology that is not relied upon is turned off in a user agent, and</li>
                        <li>when any technology that is not relied upon is not supported by a user agent</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>In addition, the following success criteria apply to all content on the page, including content that is not otherwise relied upon to meet conformance, because failure to meet them could interfere with any use of the page:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>1.4.2 - Audio Control</strong>,</li>
